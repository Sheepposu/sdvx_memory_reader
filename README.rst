Currently it doesn't work after a song is played cuz the memory address for stuff changes. I'm working on a fix for that, but for now it's kinda useless lol
This is a Python library/program for reading sdvx virtual memory data to get certain values. 
**TODO:** I plan searching for and adding more values to the program plus cleaning up the code a bit.
